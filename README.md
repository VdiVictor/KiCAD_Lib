# KiCAD_Lib
The library is composed of two directories, one for the footprints and one for the schematics. The 3D model folder is not included because of its size.

## Schematics
The schematics folder is subdivised in several categories. The sorting is done by component type and function:
* 00_PowerSymboles
* 01_Capacitors
* 02_Resistor
* 03_Inductor
* 04_Diodes
* 05_Transistors
* 06_ICs
* 07_Connectors
* 08_Crystal
* 09_Memory
* 99_Misc

The number allow for a better sorting of the libraries.

## Footprints
The footprint folder is subdivised according to the type of package:
* 01_Passives
* 02_Connectors
* 03_ICs
* 04_Oscillators

## Gitignore
Nothing is ignored for now
